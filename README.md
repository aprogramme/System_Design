# System Design
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to meet specific requirements. It's a blueprint that guides the implementation phase, ensuring the system is built to be functional, reliable, and scalable. Key aspects include defining the system's structure (architecture), its constituent parts (components and modules), how those parts interact (interfaces), and how data will be handled.
