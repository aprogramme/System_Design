# System Design
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to meet specific requirements. It's a blueprint that guides the implementation phase, ensuring the system is built to be functional, reliable, and scalable. Key aspects include defining the system's structure (architecture), its constituent parts (components and modules), how those parts interact (interfaces), and how data will be handled. 

## OOPs (Object Oriented Programmings)
1. Abstraction
   > Abstraction hides unnecessary implementation details from the client and exposes 
      only what is essential to use an object’s functionality.
2. Encapsulation
   > Encapsulation bundles an object’s data (its state) and the methods that operate on 
     that data into a single unit, and controls access to its inner workings.
3. Inheritance
   > Real-world objects are often related in parent-child relationships. 
   > Example: Object A (Parent) and Object B (Child) share properties. 
   > In programming, this relationship is mimicked using Inheritance. 
5. Polymorphism
   > Derived from: "Poly" (many) + "Morph" (forms) = many forms. 
   > One stimulus → different responses based on object/situation.

## UML Diagram
A UML diagram, based on the Unified Modeling Language, is a visual representation of a system's structure and behavior, used primarily in software and systems engineering.
